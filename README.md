# Testing_packages
Edit: Worked successfully

imported package in kaggle environment with 

`!pip install git+https://github.com/Harshj6301/Testing_packages.git`

This directory serves as a reference as how to structure the code to make it work as a python package


Key notes:
- setup file should be in parent directory (root directory)
- Main code should be in a child directory with an empty `__init__.py` file and the main module file.
